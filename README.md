# coding-time-tracker-client

This is the client for myCodingStats.com. It is written in Vue 2 using Vuex and Vue Router. This site was created for new developers to record the time and details of the programming they do each day. When you are learning to code, it is important to do a mix of active and passive learning. Active learning is time spent actively coding and solving your own problems. Passive learning is time watching tutorials, following guides, or reading documentation. When starting out, it is easy to get stuck only doing passive learning. This app lets you track the active and passive learning so you know if your learning is as productive as it can be.

There is a server written with Node and Express with a PostgreSQL db that accompanies this client.
